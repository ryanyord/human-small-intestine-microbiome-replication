# Replication of 2 Subfigures from https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01162-2

I replicated figure 3B (clustered co-correlation matrix heatmap) and figure 5A (PCA plot) from absolute abundance data via supplementary data in “Quantitative sequencing clarifies the role of disruptor taxa, oral microbiota, and strict anaerobes in the human small-intestine microbiome” linked above. <br>

Code to replicate my analysis can be found: /project_code.ipynb and the writeup can be found: /report.pdf <br>

Resulting Figures: <br>
